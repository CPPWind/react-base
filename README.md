# React-base: modular platform for Redux Isomorphic apps

This repository is a modular abstraction to build a typical [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) web application.
You can use it to quickly scaffold your React web app projects and dev environment for these projects.

This seed should clarify how to wire up all the modules of your application, even when we understand that in some cases
there must be some changes needed by the structure to fit your needs correctly

## Getting Started

To get you started, let's see what you need after cloning the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the React-Base repository from Github. You can get git from
[Git](http://git-scm.com).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test React-Base. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed. In addition you'll need Bower to manage the angular modules/dependencies that we've
included in the project by default. You can get them from [nodejs.org][node] and [Bower](http://www.bower.io)
